# 8.-C19-VACCINATION-EUROPE-PYTHON

In this project I analyze the situation of the COVID19 vaccination in Europe as of the 9th of September of 2021.

*DISCLAIMER*
Neither the data or the script are updated. This is the state of the analysis as of 9th of September of 2021 and will NOT be updated.
This project is just for "learning skills" purposes, so non-informative or realistic impressions should be taken from this analysis.
